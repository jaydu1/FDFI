Plan (2026-01-31)
1) Review current explainer APIs and dvi entropic DFI utilities to align a minimal, non–cross-fitting EOTExplainer design.
2) Implement OTExplainer (rename from DFIExplainer) and add EOTExplainer using entropic transport/DFI logic; update exports and example usage.
3) Add Exp3-based unit tests to validate mean/variance behavior for both explainers with fixed seeds and tolerances.
4) Update docs and add a CHANGELOG entry describing the new explainers and rename.
